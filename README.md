# Fog and the City: an urbanist's perspective

The new models for an open, distributed, collaborative computing not only do offer huge opportunities both in technological and in operational terms: they are also capable of fostering a widespread participation of civic awareness.  The basic theme of this [talk](https://robertoreale.me/ninux-day-2016), offered at the [Ninux Day 2016](http://wiki.ninux.org/NinuxDay2016/TimeTable) in Florence, encourages a vision of *computing* and *connection* as common goods, hence as *values* subtracted to a centralized control and entrusted to a collective management.

The slides are available in a printable format at [issuu](https://issuu.com/roberto-reale/docs/ninux-day-2016) as well as at [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/robertoreale/fog-and-the-city-an-urbanists-perspective).
